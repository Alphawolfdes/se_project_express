# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

## Project Name

WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

## Description

This project is the backend server for the WTWR application, which helps users decide what to wear based on weather and personal preferences. The server provides a RESTful API for user authentication, clothing item management, and weather-based recommendations. It handles database operations, security, and serves as the foundation for the client-side application.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

- Node.js & Express.js for building the server and API
- MongoDB & Mongoose for database management
- JWT for user authentication and authorization
- ESLint (Airbnb style guide) & Prettier for code quality and formatting
- Nodemon for development hot-reloading
- RESTful API design principles
- Error handling and validation
- Environment variables for configuration
- Security best practices (password hashing, input validation)

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
